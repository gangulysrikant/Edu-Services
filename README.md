# Edu-Services

Current research shows educational outcomes are far from equitable. The imbalance was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. There’s an urgent need to better understand and measure the scope and impact of the pandemic on these inequities.

# Problem Statement

The COVID-19 Pandemic has disrupted learning for more than 56 million students in the United States. In the Spring of 2020, most states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational institutions to stop the spread of the virus. In response, schools and  teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through distance learning tools and digital platforms. Until today, concerns of the exacerbating digital divide and long-term learning loss among America’s most vulnerable learners continue to grow. We attempt to answer two most crucial questions in this regard:

1.- What is the state of digital learning in 2020?
2.- And how does the engagement of digital learning relate to factors such as district demographic, braodband access and state/national policies and events.
